# Simplified-SSL-Secure-Socket-Layer-
This project aims to implement a simplified version of the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, providing secure communication between a client and a server. The SSL protocol includes features such as client authorization, secure communication using encryption and decryption, and data integrity checks using checksums.
